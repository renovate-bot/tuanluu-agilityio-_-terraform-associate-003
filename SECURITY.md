## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### What Constitutes a Security Vulnerability

Please report any of the following security issues:

#### **Critical Security Issues** üî¥
- **Hardcoded credentials** in configuration files
- **Exposed secrets** in documentation or examples
- **Malicious code** in Terraform configurations
- **Dangerous infrastructure patterns** that could compromise security
- **Privilege escalation** examples without proper warnings

#### **High Priority Issues** üü†
- **Insecure default configurations** in learning examples
- **Missing security best practices** in educational content
- **Outdated provider versions** with known vulnerabilities
- **Insecure network configurations** without educational context

#### **Medium Priority Issues** üü°
- **Missing security warnings** in potentially dangerous examples
- **Insufficient access controls** in example configurations
- **Weak encryption practices** in educational materials
- **Inadequate logging/monitoring** examples

### How to Report

#### **For Critical/High Priority Issues**

**üîê Private Reporting (Preferred)**
- **Email**: tuan.luu@asnet.com.vn
- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Brief description of issue`
- **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature

**üìß Email Template**:
```
Subject: [SECURITY] Description of vulnerability

**Type of Issue**: [Critical/High/Medium]
**Affected Component**: [Module name, file, or documentation]
**Description**: [Detailed description of the security issue]
**Impact**: [Potential impact if exploited]
**Steps to Reproduce**: [If applicable]
**Suggested Fix**: [If you have recommendations]
**Your Contact**: [How we can reach you for follow-up]
```

#### **For Medium Priority Issues**

- **GitHub Issues**: Create an issue with the `security` label
- **GitHub Discussions**: For security-related questions or clarifications

### What NOT to Report Publicly

‚ùå **Do NOT create public issues for**:
- Actual credentials or secrets (even if expired)
- Specific vulnerability details that could be exploited
- Security configurations from real production environments
- Personal or organizational security information

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

#### **Code Security** üîí

```hcl
# ‚úÖ DO: Use variables for sensitive data
variable "db_password" {
  description = "Database password"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}

resource "aws_db_instance" "example" {
  password = var.db_password
}
```

```hcl
# ‚ùå DON'T: Hardcode sensitive information
resource "aws_db_instance" "example" {
  password = "super-secret-password"  # Never do this!
}
```

#### **Documentation Security** üìù

```markdown
<!-- ‚úÖ DO: Provide security warnings -->
‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: This example creates resources with public access. 
In production, always implement proper access controls and network security.

<!-- ‚úÖ DO: Explain security implications -->
This configuration demonstrates basic setup. For production use:
- Enable encryption at rest
- Implement least-privilege access
- Use private subnets for databases
```

#### **Example Configurations** ‚öôÔ∏è

```hcl
# ‚úÖ DO: Include security best practices
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "example-bucket-${random_id.bucket_suffix.hex}"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_encryption" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id

  rule {
    apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
      sse_algorithm = "AES256"
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id

  block_public_acls       = true
  block_public_policy     = true
  ignore_public_acls      = true
  restrict_public_buckets = true
}
```

### For Learners

#### **Development Environment** üíª

```bash
# ‚úÖ DO: Use environment variables for credentials
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"

# ‚ùå DON'T: Put credentials in files
aws_access_key_id = "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"  # Never commit this
```

#### **State File Security** üìÅ

```bash
# ‚úÖ DO: Use remote state with encryption
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket  = "my-terraform-state"
    key     = "project/terraform.tfstate"
    region  = "us-west-2"
    encrypt = true
  }
}

# ‚ùå DON'T: Commit state files to version control
# Add to .gitignore:
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*
```

#### **Learning Safety** üìö

- **Use separate AWS accounts** for learning vs. production
- **Set up billing alerts** to avoid unexpected charges
- **Use least-privilege IAM policies** for learning activities
- **Clean up resources** after completing exercises
- **Never use production data** in learning exercises

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Security Considerations

### Educational Context Warnings

This project contains learning materials that may include:

#### **Intentionally Simplified Examples** üìñ
- Some examples prioritize learning over production security
- Always check for security warnings in documentation
- Production deployments require additional security measures

#### **Provider Version Pinning** üìå
- Some modules use older provider versions for consistency
- Always use latest versions in production for security patches
- Monitor provider changelogs for security updates

#### **AWS Resource Configurations** ‚òÅÔ∏è
- Examples may create publicly accessible resources for demonstration
- Always review security groups and access policies
- Use private subnets and proper network segmentation in production

### Specific Module Considerations

#### **01_Infrastructure-as-Code**
- Uses Docker provider with potential local security implications
- Container images should be from trusted sources

#### **02_Provider-versioning**
- Demonstrates version constraints but may not use latest secure versions
- Always test with latest provider versions in production

#### **03_Build & 04_Change**
- Creates EC2 instances that may be publicly accessible
- Default security groups may allow broad access

#### **06_Remote-state**
- Demonstrates Terraform Cloud integration
- Ensure proper workspace access controls in production

## üîß Secure Development Guidelines

### Pre-Commit Security Checks

```bash
# Recommended security checks before committing
terraform fmt -check -recursive
terraform validate
grep -r "password\|secret\|key" . --exclude-dir=.git
grep -r "AKIA\|ASIA" . --exclude-dir=.git  # AWS access keys
```

### Automated Security Scanning

We recommend contributors use:

- **tfsec**: Terraform static analysis security scanner
- **checkov**: Infrastructure as code security scanner
- **terraform-compliance**: BDD testing for Terraform

```bash
# Install tfsec
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/tfsec/master/scripts/install_linux.sh | bash

# Scan Terraform files
tfsec .

# Install checkov
pip install checkov

# Scan with checkov
checkov -d .
```

- [ ] **Security warnings** in documentation
- [ ] **Least-privilege access** patterns
- [ ] **Proper encryption** configurations
- [ ] **Network security** best practices
- [ ] **Resource naming** doesn't expose sensitive information
